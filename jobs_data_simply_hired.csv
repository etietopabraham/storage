Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:
Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Creative problem-solver: No challenge is too complex, no issue is too hard, and “no” is not an acceptable answer.

Strong communicator: Able to drive alignment and communicate effectively to different audiences.

Ideal profile:
Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science or a related quantitative discipline

3+ years experience as a data scientist or product analyst in a consumer-facing web or mobile app environment

Experience designing and implementing A/B tests, and analyzing user experience

Hands-on experience with SQL (advanced proficiency)

Do you want to just build software, or do you want to build software that helps people improve their lives? Viamo is a mission-driven organization and communication platform that is supporting people in geographies with minimal access to the Internet (take a look at some examples of our impact here (https://viamo.io/case-studies/)). With everything that has happened in the past few years, many of us have reconsidered what we want to do with our lives and how we can make a meaningful impact. Viamo is a place where you can work with talented, driven, and thoughtful people to improve the world for the better. If that sounds intriguing, please read on…

We are looking for a passionate and experienced Staff / Senior ML/Data Engineer to design and develop high-quality, modern data-driven solutions to fulfill our mission. You will be building software that is currently used in 40+ countries (primarily across Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean) to give connectivity to people with limited technology. You will be part of a team that is building, scaling, and maintaining Viamo's products including our large-scale web application and communication platform that processes 4 million+ interactions a day and positively impacts millions of lives. In the years ahead, we are aiming to scale our platform strategy to go beyond sharing information: connecting 100 million active users to vital services and many of the benefits of the digital economy.

All our users need is a simple mobile phone and a mobile connection to get access to vital information and services. Through channels such as text messaging and Interactive Voice Response (as well as internet-based channels such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp), end-users who are farmers, expectant mothers, small business owners, and others can get access to life-changing information. Throughout the COVID pandemic, Viamo's platform was key to efforts in many countries to get public health information out to hard-to-reach populations.

We are looking for a Staff or Senior-level Machine Learning/Data Engineer who has been doing ML-focused development for 8+ years with backend development experience. Ideally, has formal training in Computer Science or Software Engineering. Specifically, we are looking for an Engineer to help us design, build, and maintain scalable Machine Learning solutions that optimize our user's experience on our platform. Experience with recommender systems and personalization engines would be a huge asset.

The successful candidate will have experience with large-scale distributed systems and ML technologies coupled with a solid understanding of database and data analytics. It would be an advantage, although not a prerequisite, to have experience in some or all of our key tech stack components, including:

MySQL
BigQuery
Google Data Studio
PHP / Laravel

(The list above represents the key ones - we use many other technologies, including AWS, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, BitBucket, etc.)

We are new to the world of Machine Learning, so we would expect you to help advise us on some of the tools and frameworks to use.

Strong written and verbal communication skills are a prerequisite, as we are a very team-oriented company working remotely with colleagues across the world, so clear communication is central to our success. We appreciate people who balance thinking long-term and pursuing technical excellence and are focused on delivering value to users. We are experienced Agile / Scrum practitioners and we operate in multi-disciplinary product crews towards shared success. If you are an independent, self-starting, and quality-minded developer with top-notch communication and analytical skills, we would like to talk to you.

About Viamo

At Viamo, we envision a world where all people have access to the information they need to make decisions for healthy, prosperous lives, and have meaningful relationships with governments, civil society, and businesses.

With more than 300 team members spread across 25 countries, and serving projects in more than 40 countries, we truly work on a global scale to catalyze a mobile tech movement. We are connecting nonprofits, governments, and businesses to the people they serve using the digital technologies they already have in their pockets (voice calls, interactive SMS, and social network chatbots). The majority of our Engineering team is based in Canada, but we have team members all over the world.

At Viamo, we value Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion. We know that diverse perspectives and experiences make our products, services, and teams stronger.

Did you know?

HR research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, but women and other under-represented people often apply only if they feel they check 100% of the requirements.

Every year, the legal system has made it difficult for millions of ordinary people to seek justice, especially for folks without means or who come from underrepresented backgrounds. Our vision is to help these injury victims get the justice they deserve, irrespective of their income, demographics, or the quality of their legal representation.

EvenUp operates across all types of injury cases, from police brutality and child abuse to California wildfires and motor vehicle accidents. Our ML-driven software empowers attorneys to accurately assess the value of these cases by doing a core part of their workflow (legal drafting), enabling them to secure larger settlements in record time. As EvenUp evaluates more cases, our proprietary data grows, enhancing the precision of our predictions and delivering more value to both attorneys and victims alike.

As one of the fastest growing startups ($0 to $10M in ARR in <2 years), we raised $65M in investment from some of the best investors in the world (Bessemer, Bain Capital, Signalfire, DCM, NFX, Tribe Capital), seasoned tech executives (i.e. founder of Quora, SVP at Google, former CPO at Uber), and public figures that care about our social mission (Nas, Jared Leto, Byron Jones). Our team comes from top tech, legal, and investing backgrounds including Waymo, Google, Amazon, Uber, Quora, Blizzard, Norton Rose, Warburg Pincus, Bain, and McKinsey.

Why we're hiring machine learning engineers:
In the past year, our engineering and data science team grew from <10 to ~30 and we rolled out infrastructure updates, new products, and updates to existing workflows - combining data, ML frontend and backend work.

Now is the time to get on the ground floor as we scale!

We are looking for machine learning engineers who are passionate about building production machine learning products with a world-class team headed up by Matyas (lead early and foundational teams at Quora and Uber). You will have immense opportunities to work on a broad range of business/technical problems and technologies, build machine learning models, and design/automate/deploy production machine learning pipelines. We share a passion for problem-solving, new technologies, and learning, so you will be highly encouraged to explore new technologies and develop innovative solutions that could take the team's machine-learning engineering capability to the next level.

You will build and deploy machine learning models in production that tangibly impact the lives of our customers
You will be responsible for technical roadmaps and will collaborate with Product Management, Product Engineering, and Design to shape the overall product roadmap
You will be a strategic partner for leaders across the organization on driving business impact through machine learning
You will coach and mentor the next generation of strong engineers on the team

What we're seeking:
Experience building machine learning systems deployed to production
Industry or research experience in NLP, information retrieval, or entity resolution
Ability to communicate technical ideas or issues in easy-to-understand and actionable terms
Ability to translate theory and new ideas into practical shippable solutions

Nice to have:
Thrive on data-driven development, always looking for ways to analyze and improve with data
Can develop methods and algorithms from first principles where necessary as opposed to relying fully on packaged third-party solutions
Learn quickly and are seeking opportunities to work cross-functionally and with a diverse group of people
Are looking for new challenges to take your craft to the next level

Benefits & Perks:
We seek to empower all of our team members to fulfill our mission of making the world a more just place, regardless of our team’s function, geography, or experience level. To that end, we offer:

Fully remote setup - work from wherever you feel is best (Plus a stipend to upgrade your home office!)Flexible working hours to match your styleOffsites - get to meet your coworkers on a fully-expensed trip every 6-12 months!Choice of great medical, dental, and vision insurance plan optionsFlexible paid time offA variety of virtual team events such as game nights & happy hours

Description of the Position: Sunnybrook research institute is seeking an exceptional postdoctoral fellow to join the Sleep and Brain Health Laboratory (https://sleepandbrainhealth.ca/) to lead development of novel, automated, scalable approaches to the quantification of sleep physiology and identification of sleep disorders from human wearable sensor data in support of several large CIHR and NIH-funded clinical studies of sleep and dementia.

The fellow will apply contemporary machine/deep learning approaches to address problems in the classification of sleep physiology and the identification of sleep disorders using new low-profile human flexible wearable sensors. (electroencephalography, electrocardiography, accelerometry, photoplethysmography). The fellow will leverage several already-collected lab-based datasets including >3000 nights of gold-standard polysomnography, and >1600 hours of co-captured in-lab polysomnography, ambulatory EEG, accelerometry, and wearable adhesive sensor cardiopulmonary data. The resulting analytic approaches will then be applied to home-based wearable sensory data from several large ongoing NIH and CIHR funded cohort studies of older adults (>1000 nights of ambulatory EEG in adults with cognitive impairment, >60,000 nights of human accelerometry data from older adults with and without dementia, and >4000 nights of overnight cardiopulmonary data from older adults with and without dementia) to determine if sleep and other physiological characteristics identified using these approaches can predict dementia outcomes and dementia-related brain changes. In addition to data analysis and algorithm development, the fellow will also be involved in guiding students and staff involved in data collection.

The position requires working closely with the PIs Dr. Lim (sleep and circadian physiology, neurology, genetics) and Dr. Goubran (machine learning, computational neuroscience), and with graduate students, staff and developers in the lab to achieve these aims. New approaches and ideas are encouraged, as are independent projects that dovetail with current studies. There will be opportunities for multiple publications on novel analytic approaches to wearable sensor data for sleep, and the links between these data and dementia outcomes. Training in clinical research and in the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of human sleep physiological data will be provided.

This is a fully funded position. Salary is commensurate with experience and with CIHR/NIH stipend levels. Contract is renewable contingent on performance.

Required Qualifications:
PhD in received within the last 5 years or graduating PhD candidate in computer science, biomedical engineering, physics, computational neuroscience, or a related quantitative field
Solid publication record related to machine learning and signal processing
